* midikbd

A program that transforms an xinput keyboard (ASCII) into a MIDI
keyboard.

As of now, it simply grabs the entire keyboard and translates keycodes
directly into MIDI notes.

** Example

Check available devices with =xinput=. If your keyboard's ID is 9, and
you'd like to create MIDI port "Hello there!", run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
midikbd 9 "Hello there!"
#+END_SRC

Now, run =aconnect -i -l= to see the available input devices. Remember
the client number of =Hello there!=. Let's say it's 129.

Run =aconnect -o -l= to see the list of output devices. Let's say we're
looking for =FLUID Synth=, and its client number is 130.

Connect the input and output together:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
aconnect 129 130
#+END_SRC

Try pressing some keys on device 9. It should produce sound. If the
program grabbed your only keyboard, well, back luck; kill it from a TTY.
